#Abstraction:
 It is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential or necessary 
 information of an object. 

#Key Features of Abstraction:
1.Security: Users do not need to know the implementation details of a function or method.
2.Focus on Essentials: It allows the programmer to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

How Abstraction Works in C++:
1.Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited by other classes. 
It has at least one pure virtual function (a function with no definition and declared with = 0).
2.Pure Virtual Function: A virtual function that must be implemented by derived classes.

Example 1: Abstraction Using Abstract Class
In this example, we'll create an abstract class Shape with a pure virtual function area().
 The derived classes (Circle and Rectangle) must provide their own implementation for the area() function.
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for M_PI constant
using namespace std;
// Abstract class (contains at least one pure virtual function)
class Shape {
public:
    // Pure virtual function providing interface framework
    virtual double area() = 0; // This is an abstract method
};
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;
public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    // Implementing the pure virtual function
    double area() override {
        return M_PI * radius * radius;
    }
};
class Rectangle : public Shape {
private:
    double length;
    double width;
public:
    Rectangle(double l, double w) : length(l), width(w) {}
    // Implementing the pure virtual function
    double area() override {
        return length * width;
    }
};
int main() {
    Shape *shape1 = new Circle(5.0);      // Creating an object of Circle
    Shape *shape2 = new Rectangle(4.0, 5.0); // Creating an object of Rectangle

    cout << "Area of Circle: " << shape1->area() << endl;    // Output: 78.5398
    cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << shape2->area() << endl; // Output: 20
    // Cleanup
    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;

    return 0;
}
Output:
Area of Circle: 78.5398
Area of Rectangle: 20
Explanation:
The class Shape is an abstract class because it has the pure virtual function area().
The derived classes (Circle and Rectangle) implement the area() function.
We don't need to know how the area is calculated in each shape; we just call the area() function and get the result.
 This is the essence of abstraction — showing only the necessary details.

1.Instead of using Shape* shape1 = new Triangle(...);, we simply create instances of Triangle and Square directly
 using Triangle triangle(...); and Square square(...);.
2.Calling Methods Without Pointers:
Since the objects are not created with pointers, we don't need to use the arrow operator (->). We can directly call the method using the dot operator (.), like triangle.area() and square.area().
3.Automatic Memory Management:
Since we're not using dynamic memory allocation (new), we don't need to manually delete the objects. 
Memory will be automatically managed, and the objects will be destroyed when they go out of scope (at the end of the main function).

    Circle circle(5.0);             // Circle object with radius 5.0
    Rectangle rectangle(4.0, 5.0);  // Rectangle object with length 4.0 and width 5.0

    // Calculating and displaying the area using dot operator
    cout << "Area of Circle: " << circle.area() << endl;      // Output: 78.5398
    cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << rectangle.area() << endl; // Output: 20

    return 0;

// C++ Program to Demonstrate the
// working of Abstraction
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class implementAbstraction {
private:
    int a, b;
public:
    // method to set values of
    // private members
    void set(int x, int y)
    {
        a = x;
        b = y;
    }
    void display()
    {
        cout << "a = " << a << endl;
        cout << "b = " << b << endl;
    }
};
int main()
{
    implementAbstraction obj;
    obj.set(10, 20);
    obj.display();
    return 0;
}
Output:
a = 10
b = 20

Advantages of Data Abstraction:
1.Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
2.Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user.
3.Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
4.It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.
7.New features or changes can be added to the system with minimal impact on existing code.
